# Ingesting OSDU public datasets in ADME for demo purposes

Work in progress Mahesh Balusa

In the world of subsurface data management, time spent on data preparation can often delay critical insights and innovation. This section is designed to eliminate that bottleneck by delivering pre-prepared, standardized public datasets that are ready for immediate ingestion into the OSDU platform using Azure Data Management for Energy.

Whether you're a data engineer, geoscientist, or IT professional, this session allows you to focus on what truly matters—ingesting and consuming data—without the overhead of formatting, validating, or transforming it. By working with curated demo datasets aligned with the OSDU data model, you'll gain hands-on experience with the ingestion process and quickly unlock the value of subsurface data within your workflows.

Here are the public datasets we are making available for you:

<ul>
  <li><strong>TNO dataset</strong><br>
