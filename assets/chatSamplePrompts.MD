## Starter Prompts
Here are some sample prompts based for the dataset available from New Zealand Petroleum Data Pach<br>
> ``` What can you tell me about Taranaki basin? ```

> What data is available in this dataset for Taranaki Basin? 

> How many wellbores are currently producing in Taranaki Basin?

> Create a summary of wellbore stability reports and drilling logs for wells drilled in Taranaki Basin with abnormal pressure readings

> What are the specific geological hazards in the Taranaki Basin and the implications of these hazards for drilling operations?

> Generate a table with all wells and/or wellbores in Taranaki Basin with all important attributes including latitude and longitude, wellbore events, status and operating company

> How many wellbores are currently producing?

> How many wellbores are currently abandoned?

> What is the distribution of wellbores by purpose (exploration, appraisal, development)?

> How many wellbores exist in each basin?

> How many wellbores exist in each license block?

> What is the average time from spud to completion for all wellbores?

> What could you tell me about Copper Moki-3 wellbore? 

> What could you tell me about Kauri well?

> Generate a list of wells in Taranaki Basin.

> Provide an executive summary for all geological basins.

> What percentage of wellbores are onshore vs. offshore in the dataset?

> Which countries have the highest wellbore density?

> Which basins have the highest wellbore density?

> Which operator has the highest number of wellbores in the dataset?

> What is the average completion time for each operator?

> What is the most common wellbore purpose for each operator?

> Find all wellbore stability reports and drilling logs for wells drilled in Taranaki Basin with abnormal pressure readings

> Which basin has the highest number of producing wells relative to total wellbores?

> Which fields have the most producing wellbores?

> Which operators have the most wellbores in each license block?

> Which operators have the most wellbores in 38349 license block?

> How many wellbores have been completed in each license block in the past 10 years?

> What is the compliance status of wellbores based on regulatory reporting requirements?

> What are the specific geological hazards in the Taranaki Basin and the implications of these hazards for drilling operations?

> [in PowerBI] Create a page that provides an overview of wellbore information, including Basins, total depth benchmarking, a map that highlights wellbores and geological features in the area, wellbore environment and status

> [in Word] Based on historical drilling and wellbore geological data of Taranaki Basin, generate a detailed report that summarizes key findings from long geological reports, highlighting critical insights related to drilling NPD and drilling hazards. Please very detailed and technical on the response

> [!NOTE] 
> You can try in different language and suggest the audience to provide their own “prompts” using their experience or handover documents
